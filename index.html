      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>
        I&nbsp;use HD44780 character displays in my projects, both I2C and
        parallel. Unfortunately, I&nbsp;couldn't find any online tool that would
        allow me to create custom characters AND test them in a&nbsp;sequence at
        the same time. I&nbsp; could use a&nbsp;spare Raspberry Pi or Arduino,
        but it would require me to have some free space on my desk, connect all
        the wires, including pull-up resistors, and upload a&nbsp;new program
        every single time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This web application implements the Hitachi HD44780 character map (ROM
        Code A00: ASCII, Japanese, European characters, math symbols). It is
        possible to change the memory data for the first 8&nbsp;characters and
        get their binary representation, compatible with
        <code>createChar()</code> function. The text you enter must be
        a&nbsp;valid JavaScript multiline string, so it can be copied over to
        your own script with little to no changes, regardless of the programming
        language you use. It is also possible to change the display size and
        move the cursor around.
