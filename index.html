      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>
        I use HD44780 character displays in my projects, both I2C and parallel.
        Unfortunately, I couldn't find any online tool that would allow me to
        create custom characters AND test them in a sequence at the same time. I
        could use spare Raspberry Pi or Arduino, but it would require me to have
        some free space on my desk, connect all the wires including pull-up
        resistors, and upload new program every single time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This web application implements Hitachi HD44780 character map (ROM Code
        A00 - ASCII, Japanese, European characters, math symbols). It is
        possible to change data for first 8 characters and get their binary
        representation, compatible with <code>createChar()</code> function. The
        text you enter must be a valid JavaScript multiline string, so it can be
        copied over to your own script with little to no changes, regardless of
        programming language you use. It is also possible to change display size
        and move cursor around.
